# Homework for QA GURU Python lesson 10

Task:

Refactor your test for student registration using the form at https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form, using object-oriented paradigm tools to encapsulate the implementation details of user business steps, thus implementing the ideas of the Page Object pattern.
The task consists of several parts, each of which should be submitted as a separate link to the corresponding branch in the test repository for the demoqa application (all links in one message in the comments below).


PART I (implement in the branch "mid-level-step-objects")

In this part, we consider a valuable user business step such as "filling in individual user data" or "confirming the result of the work done" (e.g., confirming a successful registration).


PART II (implement in the branch "high-level-step-objects")

In this part, we consider a valuable user business step such as "submitting the form with data" or, in other words, "conducting registration via the form." We also consider confirming the result of the work done as a step (e.g., confirming a successful registration).
In this part, it is also necessary to refactor the user data handling by representing them as an object of a data class, using the knowledge gained from previous lessons.
